    About us
Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) is running 268 residential educational institutions (from 5th standard to Undergraduate level) in the state of Telangana under the Ministry of Scheduled Caste Development, Government of Telangana. The Society has been working with the noble aim of providing quality education to the needy and deprived children on par with the other advantaged children. The TSWREIS has been catering to the dire educational needs of the marginalized children especially Scheduled Caste (SC) children hailing from the remote rural areas of Telangana. Over the last three decades the Society has been cruising along the path of glory, and this depth finds reflection in the way the Society is excelling in academics, sports, mountaineering, communication skills, etc

Apart from providing quality education to the children, the Society is making determined efforts to create an environment that builds their confidence levels, leadership and communication skills to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Get directions  Education is the key to all-round human 
development. The education development of its 
citizens determines a nationâ€™s economic, social, 
and cultural progress. India is a pluralist country 
with rich diversity reflected in the multitude 
of cultures, religions, and languages of various 
groups. There is a however significant disparity 
in the socio-economic parameters of multiple 
groups/communities residing in the country. 
Some groups, notably the Scheduled Castes, have 
been traditionally marginalized and economically 
backward concerning the total population of the 
country. Educational development is the most 
effective instrument for their empowerment. 
Residential schools have the potential to help the 
marginalized and the poor to come out of the 
poverty trap and facilitate them to be on par with 
the rest of the citizens.<BR>
Residential schools provide value-based education 
in a stress-free environment, which enables the 
students to determine their inner talents and 
flourish them to the fullest potential. Residential 
schools broaden the vision and enlighten the way 
to the future of a child by the totality of discipline, 
which called Education.<BR>
The mission of the Telangana Social Welfare 
Residential Educational Institutions is to promote 
Karunakar<BR>

a wide range of curricular and extracurricular 
activities beyond the cones of classrooms. It aimed to 
create a vibrant teaching and learning environment 
and help marginalized students realize their full 
potential in every sphere of life in the 21st century.
The vision of the Residential schools is to build an 
outstanding government educational institution 
that provides high quality holistic and value-based 
education to marginalized children on par with the 
other advantaged children in the country.
The TELANGANA Social Welfare Residential 
Educational Institutions Society (APSWREIS) 
established under the Societies Act as an 
autonomous body. The TSWREI Society hitherto 
part of the erstwhile APSWREI Society emerged 
as an independent entity in June 2014 after the 
bifurcation of the state of Andhra Pradesh.
Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational 
Institutions Society (TSWREIS) under the aegis of 
the Ministry of Welfare, Government of Telangana, 
has been passionately working to place the poorest 
among the Scheduled Castes in the prosperous orbit 
through quality education for the last 35 years. This 
Society, with 268 institutions with 150000 students, 
has been providing quality education in English 
medium up to graduation.<BR>
Literature Review<BR>
The residential school is an old pattern in Indian 
Education since the Vedic Age, which we called 
Gurukul. The system of Gurukul was very different 
from other modes of teaching or learning of any 
kind of education or technique. Now a day, its 
value or scope rises more and more. Because of 
the discipline among management and teaching 
staff; and the methodology of education, which 
varies and optimum from other education patterns. 
Residential care programs widely recognized as 
an integral part of child welfare programs to help 
marginalized children.<BR>
Singh T. (1981) studied the conditions of education 
amongst the scheduled tribes and scheduled caste 
students of few schools in Uttar Pradesh.
Singh. R.R. (1981) studied the identification of 
adjustment problems of the scheduled cast and 
scheduled tribe students in residential schools 
approved by the government of India under the 
scholarship scheme. He had contacted 140 students 
through the use of questionnaires and personal 
interviews.<BR>
Jain.V.K. (1960) and Flartym. E.J. (1966) conducted interviews.
