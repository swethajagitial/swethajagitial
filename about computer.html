    <p style="color: black;font-size: 40px;">A computer is an electronic device wherein we need to input raw data to be processed with a set of programs to produce a desirable output. Computers have the ability to store, process, and manipulate data. The term “computer” is derived from the Latin word “computare,” which means “to calculate.” A computer is made to run programs and apps by using both hardware and software. It also has a memory to store data, programs, and what they produce. The Full Form of Computer is “Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research.”... </p>

    <p style="color: black;font-size: 40px;">To understand the development of computers, and how they evolved from simple mechanical devices to the complex electronic machines that we use today. The knowledge can help to appreciate the challenges that computer scientists have faced over the years and the ingenuity they have shown in overcoming them.

    Studying the history of computers can help to anticipate future developments in the field. The history of computers can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, who used the abacus to perform simple calculations. In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator, which could perform more complex calculations. In the 19th century, Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine, which is considered to be the first general-purpose computer. By understanding the history of computers that have shaped the development in the past....</p>
